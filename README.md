## Data
This data set contains data that have been collected from public sources.
The column "Date" corresponds to date of application (if not found, date of announcement is provided).
This data set will be completed and cleaned within the next weeks.

The list of non-pharmaceutical interventions used to describe the intervention strategy in the different countries is provided.
Intervention measures are organised in categories; level L1 is the broadest description of the measure while L4 provide the smallest level of detail. 
The column "comment" provides a fine description of the implemented measure.

The CCCSL is an ongoing collaborative project, built in a time limited by the emergency of the situation. The CCCSL will be continuously updated and new countries will added.
